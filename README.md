This is the source code of Sodh.

“Sodh” is a web application that takes natural language text command from the user, extracts required information from that input using controlled natural language processing, and uses that information to perform complex AI tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, market basket analysis, etc. as required by the user.

The system performs machine learning and data mining tasks, all by means of a very easy-to-use natural language user interface (NLUI). This higher level of abstraction in “Sodh” obviates both the idea of writing complex AI code and the steep learning curve involved in any AI algorithm, as the user can simply **upload their dataset** and **use some keywords** to convey to the program exactly what they want to achieve, and the program automatically does it for them.

The project could be used in many educational and corporate settings, to allow even non-technical people to take advantage of complex data mining algorithms for their business ventures or research activities.
